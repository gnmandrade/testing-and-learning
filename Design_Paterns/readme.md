# Design Paterns

This folder is dedicated to learning Design Paterns.
It will contain multiple subfolders, each containing sample implementations
of a different patern.

Contents:

- MVC

### SOLID principles
SOLID is an acronym for good practices that we should follow
while programing.
This stands for:
+ S - Single responsability
+ O - Open to extension, Closed for modification
+ L - Liskov substitution principle
A child class should be able to replace the parent class
in the code without breaking anything.
+ I - Interface segregation principle
Single responsability for interfaces
+ D - Dependency Inversion principle
High-level classes manage the system and should remain as
stable as possible.

### STUPID principles
STUPID is also an acronym, but for practices to avoid.
Each letter stands for:
+ S - Singleton
+ T - Tight Coupling
+ U - Untestability
+ P - Premature Opetimization
+ I - Indescriptive Naming
+ D - Duplication
