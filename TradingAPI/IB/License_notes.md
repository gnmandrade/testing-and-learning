# Note to the Repository's Licence
The contents of this folder may be subject to a different license/copyright

Applications of the library freely available on the Interactive Brokers

the repository does not give any waranty or garantee on the implementation,
and the functions of the library might be subject to their own usage rules
to be defined only by the software owners.

Actual trading involves risks and might cause large losses for the investor.
If you try this yourself, please acknowledge the risk that is being taken
and be aware that the owner of this repository does not assume any
responsability on those losses, whatever their cause may be.
